## Idea

### G and F Cleff Trainer (Gamify it)
- will show music sheet with some notes
- user has to tap on the correct note
- notes can be tapped by a music notes wheel
- if the note is b or #, then have additional 5 notes to display outside wheel
- notes from music notes wheel will be disabled when b or # are applied to them, only show outside wheel
- and vice-versa, if notes are regular 7 notes, then disabled notes outside the music scroll wheel
